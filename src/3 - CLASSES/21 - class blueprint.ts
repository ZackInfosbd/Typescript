/**
 * Objects are the concrete things we work with in our code, the data structures we use to store data store mothods and execute them.
 
 * the classes are the blueprint of the objects used programatically, we use classes to make coppies or instances of those objects wherever nedded.

 * the class syntax is the syntax sugar for constructor functions.

 * the class has fields and methods which will be constructed to object properties and methods

# Bridge Design Pattern

The Bridge Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that helps in separating the abstraction from its implementation, allowing the two to vary independently. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where an abstraction can have multiple implementations, and you want to decouple the interface from the implementation to reduce compile-time dependencies and increase flexibility.

## Implementation

The implementation of the Bridge pattern involves the following key components:

- **Abstraction**: This defines the abstraction's interface and maintains a reference to an object of type Implementor.
- **RefinedAbstraction**: Extends or refines the interface defined by Abstraction.
- **Implementor**: Defines the interface for implementation classes.
- **ConcreteImplementor**: Implements the Implementor interface and defines its concrete implementation.

The Abstraction contains a reference to the Implementor. Clients interact with the Abstraction, which delegates the work to the Implementor.

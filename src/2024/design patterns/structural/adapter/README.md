# Adapter Design Pattern

The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by converting the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects. This pattern is especially useful when you want to integrate new features or components into existing systems without altering those systems.

## How It Works

- **Target Interface**: This is the interface that the client expects or works with.
- **Adaptee**: This is the class that has the existing interface that needs adapting.
- **Adapter**: This is the class that implements the Target interface and contains a reference to an Adaptee object. It translates calls to the Target interface into calls to the Adaptee interface.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Identify the Target Interface**: This is the interface that your application expects to work with.
2. **Create the Adapter Class**: This class implements the Target interface.
3. **Add a Reference to the Adaptee**: The Adapter class holds a reference to the Adaptee.
4. **Implement the Target Interface**: The Adapter class translates the Target interface calls to the Adaptee's interface.

## Benefits

- **Increased Flexibility**: Allows existing classes to work together without modifying their source code.
- **Reusability**: Enables the reuse of existing functionality through an adapter.
- **Decoupling**: Clients are decoupled from the specific implementations of the interfaces they use.

# Singleton Design Pattern

The Singleton Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where a single point of control is needed over a resource or service, such as a connection to a database, a system's configuration manager, or access to system-wide resources.

## Implementation

Implementing the Singleton pattern involves:

1. **Making the Constructor Private**: This prevents other classes from instantiating the class directly.
2. **Creating a Private Static Instance**: This holds the single instance of the class.
3. **Providing a Public Static Method**: This method returns the single instance of the class, creating it if it doesn't already exist.

## Benefits

- **Controlled Access**: Ensures controlled access to the single instance.
- **Lazy Initialization**: The instance is created only when it is needed for the first time.
- **Global Access Point**: Provides a global access point to the instance.
- **Reduced Memory Footprint**: Only one instance is created, reducing the memory footprint.

# Form Builder Design Pattern

The Form Builder Design Pattern is a creational pattern used in the context of form generation, where the goal is to separate the construction of a complex form from its representation. This pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of a form using the same construction process. It's particularly useful in applications where forms are dynamic or their configuration is complex.

## Key Concepts

- **Builder Interface**: This defines the methods needed to build the parts of the form. These methods are implemented by concrete builders.

- **Concrete Builder**: Implements the builder interface and provides specific implementations for the building steps. Each concrete builder corresponds to a different representation of the form.

- **Director**: Optionally, a director class can be used to manage the construction process for a builder. It knows which builder to use to get the desired form representation.

- **Product**: The final form that is built by the concrete builder. The product can vary in type and complexity depending on the builder used.

# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

The Abstract Factory Design Pattern is an advanced structural pattern that extends the basic concept of factory methods. It's used to provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This pattern is particularly useful when a system needs to be independent from how its products are created, composed, and represented.

## Key Concepts

- **Abstract Factory**: An interface that declares a set of methods for creating abstract products. These products are related by a theme or concept but vary in their actual implementations.

- **Concrete Factory**: Implements the abstract factory interface to create concrete products. Each concrete factory corresponds to a specific variant of products and creates all the products for that variant.

- **Abstract Product**: Declares an interface for a type of product object. The abstract factory pattern can involve multiple abstract products, all of which are created by a factory.

- **Concrete Product**: Implements the abstract product interface to define a product object to be created by the corresponding concrete factory. Each variant of the product is implemented by a separate concrete product class.

- **Client**: Uses interfaces declared by the abstract factory and abstract product classes. It's isolated from the implementation details of the products it gets from a factory.

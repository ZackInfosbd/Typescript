# Factory Design Pattern:

- **The Factory Design Pattern** is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern is particularly useful when a system needs to be independent of how its objects are created, composed, or represented. It's all about creating an object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to the newly created object using a common interface

The Factory Design Pattern is a fundamental concept in software design that emphasizes the principle of encapsulation when it comes to object creation. This pattern falls under the category of creational design patterns, which deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The main goal of the Factory Pattern is to enhance flexibility and maintainability of code by decoupling the object creation process from its usage.

### Key Concepts

- **Abstraction in Creation**: The Factory Pattern abstracts the process of object creation from the client. This means the client does not need to know any details about how objects are created or what their dependencies are. All the client needs to know is how to use the interface provided.

- **Subclassing for Customization**: It allows for customization in the creation process without changing the client code. By subclassing the factory, different types of objects can be created with the same creation code in the client.

- **Common Interface**: Objects created by a factory are returned with a common interface. This ensures that the client code stays the same even when the actual object type being created changes.

### Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: It provides a high level of flexibility in the code. Changes to the type of objects created or the creation process itself require changes only in the factory, not in the client code.

2. **Scalability**: Adding new types of objects to a system can be done easily by introducing new factories or extending existing ones, without affecting the client code.

3. **Decoupling**: It helps in decoupling the code that generates objects from the code that uses objects. This makes the system easier to manage, extend, and maintain.

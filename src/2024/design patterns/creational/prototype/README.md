# Prototype Design Pattern

The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that involves creating objects based on a template of an existing object through cloning. This pattern is particularly useful when the construction of a new object is more efficient through copying than through instantiation and when objects share the same configuration but differ in their state.

## Key Concepts

- **Prototype**: This is the original object that is used as the template to create new objects. The prototype must support cloning, which can be shallow or deep depending on the requirements.

- **Concrete Prototype**: Implements the cloning method. In languages like JavaScript or TypeScript, this can be achieved by implementing a method that returns a copy of the object.

- **Client**: The client selects a suitable prototype and clones it to create new objects. The client can customize the newly created object without affecting the original prototype.

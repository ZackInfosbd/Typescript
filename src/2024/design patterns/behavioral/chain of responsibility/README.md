# Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows passing a request along a chain of handlers. Instead of sending the request to a specific handler directly, the pattern sends it to the first handler in the chain. Each handler then either processes the request or passes it to the next handler in the chain.

# Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows passing a request along a chain of handlers. Instead of sending the request to a specific handler directly, the pattern sends it to the first handler in the chain. Each handler then either processes the request or passes it to the next handler in the chain.

## Concept

Imagine a scenario in a customer support system where a request can be handled by different departments (e.g., Technical Support, Billing, Customer Service) based on the nature of the request. The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows the request to be passed along a chain of potential handlers until one of them handles the request.

## Benefits

- **Decoupling of Request Sender and Receivers**: The sender of a request does not need to know which part of the chain will handle the request, which simplifies the code and improves flexibility.
- **Dynamic Reconfiguration**: Handlers in the chain can be dynamically added or changed, allowing more flexibility in how requests are handled.
- **Reduced Coupling**: The pattern helps to reduce coupling by avoiding the need for the sender to have explicit knowledge of the handler's implementation.

## Implementation Example (TypeScript)

Below is a simplified example of implementing the Chain of Responsibility pattern in TypeScript:

## When to Use

- When more than one object can handle a request, and the handler is not known in advance.
- When you want to issue a request to one of several objects without specifying the receiver explicitly.
- To decouple the sender and receiver of a request based on the type of request.

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where a request might be handled by multiple handlers, and the specific handler is not known in advance or might change dynamically.

This format provides a clear and structured way to document the Chain of Responsibility design pattern in your README.md, making it easier for others to understand and implement in their projects.

# Interpreter Design Pattern

The Interpreter design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a representation for a language's grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language. This pattern is particularly useful for designing compilers and interpreters for domain-specific languages (DSLs), but it can also be applied to other scenarios where interpreting expressions according to a specific grammar is required.

## Concept

Imagine you're creating a simple mathematical expression evaluator that can perform operations like addition and multiplication on integers. Instead of writing a complex series of if-else statements to parse and evaluate expressions, you can use the Interpreter pattern to define a grammar for these expressions, represent expressions as an abstract syntax tree (AST), and then interpret these expressions.

## Benefits

- **Flexibility**: New expressions and grammar rules can be added easily by defining new terminal and non-terminal expressions.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Separates the grammar definition and interpretation logic from the main application logic.
- **Reusability**: The grammar and interpreter can be reused across different applications that require similar expression evaluation.

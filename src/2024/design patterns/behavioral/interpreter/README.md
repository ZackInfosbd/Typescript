# Interpreter Design Pattern

The Interpreter design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a representation for a language's grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language. This pattern is particularly useful for designing compilers and interpreters for domain-specific languages (DSLs), but it can also be applied to other scenarios where interpreting expressions according to a specific grammar is required.

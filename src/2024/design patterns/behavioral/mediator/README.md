# Mediator Design Pattern

The Mediator design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that reduces the direct communication between objects or components by introducing a mediator object that controls and coordinates the interactions between them. This pattern promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, which allows for independent changes in their interaction.

## Concept

Imagine a scenario where various components, such as buttons, text inputs, and sliders in a user interface, need to interact with each other. Instead of each component calling methods of other components directly, a mediator can encapsulate how these components interact. This way, components only communicate with the mediator, which knows how to route requests and data between components.

## Benefits

- **Loose Coupling**: Components are decoupled from each other, making them easier to modify, extend, or reuse.
- **Centralized Control**: The mediator centralizes complex communications and control logic between objects in the system.
- **Simplifies Object Protocols**: Reduces the subclasses that deal with communications between objects, simplifying the overall system structure.
- **Abstracts How Objects Cooperate**: Makes it easier to understand and maintain the interactions between components.

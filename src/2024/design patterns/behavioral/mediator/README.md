# Mediator Design Pattern

The Mediator design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that reduces the direct communication between objects or components by introducing a mediator object that controls and coordinates the interactions between them. This pattern promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, which allows for independent changes in their interaction.

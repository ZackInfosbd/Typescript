# Visitor Design Pattern

The Visitor design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to perform operations on a collection of objects with differing types without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates. It achieves this by using a technique called double dispatch.

## Concept

Imagine a computer hardware system consisting of several components like CPU, RAM, and Hard Drive. Now, if you want to perform operations like `updateDriver` or `checkHealth` on these components, traditionally, you might add these methods to each component's class. However, this approach quickly becomes unmanageable as you add more operations or components. The Visitor pattern allows you to keep these operations separate from the components' classes.

## Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: It keeps the operations on elements separate from the elements themselves.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: You can introduce a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each operation gets its own class, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.

## When to Use

- When you have operations that should be performed on the elements of an object structure, and you want to avoid making the elements responsible for these operations.
- When new operations need to be added frequently to the object structure without changing the structures themselves.
- When you have a structure with many classes of objects with differing interfaces, and you need to perform operations on these objects that depend on their concrete classes.

The Visitor pattern provides a way to add operations to object structures without changing the structures or the elements. It is particularly useful for maintaining open/closed principle in systems with a fixed set of elements but an expanding set of operations on those elements.

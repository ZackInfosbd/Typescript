# Iterator Design Pattern

The Iterator design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. It enables the traversal of objects such as arrays, trees, and graphs in a standardized manner. This pattern decouples the collection from the traversal logic, allowing different kinds of iterators to be used for the same collection.

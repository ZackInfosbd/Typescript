# State Design Pattern

The State design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is used to encapsulate varying behavior for the same object, based on its internal state. It can be thought of as a way to dynamically change the 'strategy' an object uses to handle requests.

## Concept

Imagine a media player application that can be in different states, such as Playing, Paused, or Stopped. Each state has different behaviors for the same operations, such as play, pause, or stop. The State pattern enables the Media Player object to change its behavior depending on its state, by changing the state object it delegates these operations to.

## Benefits

- **Encapsulation of Varying Behavior**: Behaviors associated with a particular state are encapsulated within state-specific classes. This makes the system easier to extend and maintain.
- **Simplifies Complex Conditional Logic**: Instead of relying on complex conditional logic to determine how to execute operations based on the current state, the state object handles the specifics.
- **Follows the Open/Closed Principle**: New states can be added without changing the context or other states, making the system more modular and extensible.

## When to Use

- When an object's behavior depends on its state, and it must change its behavior at runtime depending on that state.
- When complex conditional logic controls the object's behavior based on its current state. This pattern moves such logic into separate classes corresponding to the object's states.

The State pattern is particularly useful in applications where objects may need to change their behavior in response to internal changes in state, without exposing the complexities of those state transitions to the client.

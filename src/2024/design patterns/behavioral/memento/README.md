# Memento Design Pattern

The Memento design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to save its state so that it can be restored to this state later, without revealing the details of its implementation. This pattern is particularly useful for implementing features such as undo mechanisms in applications.

## Concept

Imagine you're writing a text editor that supports undo functionality. Each time the user makes changes to the text, the state of the editor needs to be saved so that the user can revert to a previous state if needed. The Memento pattern enables saving the state of the editor without exposing its internal structure, which might include complex data structures or state that should not be accessible from outside the editor.

## Benefits

- **Encapsulation of State**: The internal state of an object is encapsulated within the memento, preventing other objects from altering it.
- **Simplifies Originator**: The object that creates the memento (originator) doesn't need complex logic to create and restore snapshots of its state.
- **History Management**: It allows maintaining a history of an object's states without compromising the integrity of the object's data.

## When to Use

- When you need to capture and restore an object's internal state at a particular point in time without violating encapsulation.
- When direct access to the object's fields/getters/setters violates encapsulation.
- When you want to provide a rollback mechanism, such as an undo feature in applications.

The Memento pattern is a powerful tool for state preservation and restoration, enabling the implementation of complex undo mechanisms and state tracking functionalities while maintaining object encapsulation and integrity.

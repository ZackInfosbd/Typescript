# State Design Pattern

The State design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern treats the state of an object as an object in its own right that can vary independently from other objects.

## Concept

Imagine a document editing application that can be in different states, such as Draft, Moderation, and Published. Each state has different behaviors for the same operations, such as editing content or publishing the document. The State pattern enables the Document object to change its behavior depending on its state, by changing the state object it delegates these operations to.

## Benefits

- **Encapsulation of Varying Behavior**: By encapsulating the behaviors within state objects, you avoid complex conditional logic in the context object.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: You can introduce new states without changing the context or other states, adhering to the open/closed principle.
- **Simplifies Maintenance**: Since state-specific behaviors are encapsulated in their respective classes, maintaining and modifying behaviors becomes easier and more modular.

## When to Use

- When an object's behavior depends on its state, and it must change its behavior at runtime depending on that state.
- When operations have large, multipart conditional statements that depend on the object's state. This state-dependent behavior can be moved into separate state classes.

The State pattern is a powerful tool for managing state-dependent behavior, making code more organized, and simplifying the maintenance of state-dependent logic.
